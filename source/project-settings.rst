Title and Description fields are both used when searching for matching text under **Projects**.
If you have several projects, it can help to add hashtags to your project descriptions
for topics you want to return to quickly.

Why Add Upgrades?
"""""""""""""""""

There are many reasons that you might want to have an upgraded project.

* To give your project access to the internet. For example,
   * To download a software package from the internet.
   * To use Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab with your project.
   * To download datasets into your project.
   * To connect to your project with SSH.
* To get extra storage space (both RAM and disk space).
* To get more compute resources.
* To have a higher idle timeout threshold. (See `What is an idle timeout? <https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/wiki/AllAboutProjects#idle-timeout>`_.)

You can share upgrades with any project that you are a collaborator on. You must be a collaborator (or owner) to update a project.

For details on paid subscriptions, see `Subscription and Pricing Information <https://cocalc.com/policies/pricing.html>`_.
Paid subscriptions start at \$14 per month.

View Current Resources
""""""""""""""""""""""

You can view allocated upgrades and current resource use under `Project usage and quotas`.
Here's an example for a project with no upgrades added (note the warning banner that
appears if the project does not have Member Hosting or Internet Access):

Adjust Quotas
"""""""""""""

When you click `Adjust Quotas...`, a dialog like the following appears. The screenshot shows numbers
for a project that has not been upgraded.
Available upgrades show what the numbers would be if you just purchased a Standard Plan and
have not applied any upgrades yet:

You can enter any values that do not exceed available upgrades. This example continues
by adding as much in the way of resources as possible to the current project.
You can remove upgrades at any time and apply them to other projects.

Max All Upgrades
""""""""""""""""

Clicking `Max All Upgrades` will add as much as possible from available upgrades:

Save Changes
""""""""""""
Then clicking `Save Changes` will apply the changes and restart the project if settings have changed:
