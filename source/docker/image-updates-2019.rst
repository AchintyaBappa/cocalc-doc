----------------------

This note includes updates made to the platform over the past few weeks.

* Platform

  * Publicly sharing files isn't disabled.
  * There is a share server to serve the files.
  * The idle timeout fully works.
  * In project settings, you'll now only see the idle timeout quota and nothing else (which makes sense as all other quotas are meaningless there).
  * As admin, you can edit the idle timeout to be whatever you want for any particular project.
  * As admin, you can browse projects of your users through the admin page.

* Software

  * Julia updated to version 1.2.0

* Sagemath

  * updated to version 8.9
