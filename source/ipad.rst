Using CoCalc on an iPad
================================================

CoCalc on Web Browser on iPad
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

William Stein, who founded CoCalc, has an iPad Pro 10.5, and uses it extensively with CoCalc. It is thus possible to fully use CoCalc in Safari on an iPad.  That said, there are a `number of issues <https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AA-ipad>`_ that we are aware of, many of which have workarounds. 

**Under heavy use sometimes CoCalc will crash mobile Safari.**
The workaround is to use CoCalc in Google Chrome on iPad. Chrome does not exhibit the same behavior.
Also, note that due to session support in CoCalc, when you refresh your browser after a crash, it returns to exactly where you left off, with all files open.


Native iPad Application for CoCalc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would prefer to use CoCalc via a native application, not a web browser, you're in luck. There is a native Jupyter client for iPad called `Juno <https://juno.sh/>`_ that allows you to connect to your CoCalc projects.
