Course management
==================

No matter what you've added in the instructorâ€™s view of the course, the students will not see any files until you explicitly assign them.

Creating a new assignment
--------------------------

An assignment consists of a folder that contains one or more files to be distributed to your students.

Start off by creating a folder called assignments in the root directory of your course project. Within this folder create a subfolder called, say, Assignment1 and populate it with a Jupyter Notebook that contains the question(s) that you want your students to answer.
